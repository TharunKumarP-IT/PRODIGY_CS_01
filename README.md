This project is a simple Python program that demonstrates encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
It allows users to input a message and a shift value to securely encrypt or decrypt text.

 What is Caesar Cipher?
                   The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet
